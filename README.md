#Summary of the SQL Code

The provided SQL code is a series of SQL queries and operations related to COVID-19 data analysis. The code focuses on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations data, and itâ€™s retrieving information from two tables: "CovidDeaths$" and "CovidVaccinations$" within a database named "Project_Portfolio."

Here's a breakdown of the code:

The first few queries retrieve COVID-19 death and vaccination data from the respective tables, filtering out records where the continent is not null (excluding global or unknown entries). The data is ordered by location and date for further analysis.

The next set of queries examines COVID-19 total cases and deaths and calculates the death percentage for each location and date. There are additional queries focusing on the United States, showing the likelihood of dying if contracting COVID-19 there.

Some queries analyze the total cases in relation to the population of certain locations, calculating the percentage of the population that has been infected.

Another set of queries looks at the countries with the highest infection rate compared to their populations and the countries with the highest death count per population.

The code also explores COVID-19 data by continent, providing insights into continents with the highest death count per population.

Global COVID-19 numbers are computed, summing new cases, new deaths, and calculating the death percentage for each date, aggregating the data by date.

The code then shifts focus to the relationship between total population and vaccinations. It calculates the rolling vaccinations for each location by joining the "CovidDeaths$" and "CovidVaccinations$" tables using a common table expression (CTE) named "PopVsVac."

The code continues with various operations using the CTE, like showing the percentage of the population vaccinated for each location.

A temporary table named "#Percent_Population_Vaccinated" is created to store the data with vaccinations percentages for further analysis.

A view named "Percent_Population_Vaccinated_View" is created based on the CTE "PopVsVac," for data visualization purposes.

Overall, the SQL code performs comprehensive analyses on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations data at the global, country, and continental levels. It leverages common table expressions, temporary tables, and views to organize and present the data for further insights and potential visualization.
